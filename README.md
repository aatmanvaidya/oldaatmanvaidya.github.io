# Portfolio

This repo contains the code for my [portfolio](https://aatmanvaidya.github.io/). 
<br>
<br>
The portfolio is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. Majority of the template is inspired and the code is taken from the portfolio of [Kalpesh Krishna](https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/)

#### run the code locally
Make sure you have you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system. Given that run the below command in the folder of the code:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
