I was a part of the group selected for the semi-final and final rounds of the [Bosch Future Mobility Challenge](https://boschfuturemobility.com/) held in Cluj, Romania from 2nd May to 8th May 2023. In a nutshell, the challenge is to assemble and code an autonomous vehicle from scratch. This blog is an attempt to share my experience and learnings by participating in the challenge. 

**What is the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge**?

Bosch Future Mobility Challenge is an international technical competition initiated by Bosch Engineering Center Cluj in 2017. The competition invites student teams every year to develop autonomous driving and connectivity algorithms on 1/10 scale vehicles, provided by the company, to navigate in a designated environment simulating a smart miniature city. The students work on their projects in collaboration with Bosch experts and academic professors for several months to develop the best-performing algorithms. The best teams are selected for the finals, and the top ones are awarded great prizes. This international competition is held annually in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
