I am a SDE/ Researcher at [Tattle](https://tattle.co.in/), where I am advised by [Tarunima Prabhakar](https://tarunima.com/) and [Denny George](https://github.com/dennyabrain). I contribute to building open source tools and datasets to understand and respond to inaccurate and harmful content. 

My research interests broadly lie within `Computational Social Science`, specifically in Social Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in studying the spread of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms.  Additionally, I am also interested in examining the potential harms and societal biases perpetuated by AI models and developing methods to mitigate these harms.

Previously, I finished my Bachelors in Computer Science where I was advised by [Amit Nanavati](https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/people-1/amit-a-nanavati/) and [Seema Nagar](https://research.ibm.com/people/seema-nagar) (IBM Research India). We modelled the spread of hate speech over a social network. 

Feel free to check out my CV and drop me an email if you want to chat with me!
