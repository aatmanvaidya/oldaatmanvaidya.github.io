My name is Aatman Vaidya, a recent graduate in BTech Computer Science and Engineering. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning and Social Network Analysis. 

I received my undergraduate degree from [Ahmedabad University](https://ahduni.edu.in/). For my final year thesis, I was adivsed by [Prof. Amit Nanavati](https://ahduni.edu.in/academics/schools-centres/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/people-1/amit-a-nanavati/) and [Dr. Seema Nagar](https://research.ibm.com/people/seema-nagar). We proposed a novel model to capture the spread of Hate Speech on Twitter.

When I am not working, I am reading or playing minecraft.
